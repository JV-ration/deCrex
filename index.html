<h3>What is deCrex?</h3>

<p><strong>deCrex</strong> is an intranet application, which scans content and configurations of software development environment systems
    and then reports on consistency and completeness of the learnt information. By doing this it insures development
    teams have environment enabling them to find the code, to build, to test and to deliver their software</p>

<h3>What does deCrex do?</h3>

The entire functionality of the application can be divided into three areas:

<ul>
    <li>Since <strong>deCrex scans and understands</strong> the content of source code repositories and build servers, it becomes a
        searchable knowledge base with automatically retrieved and added descriptions of available software modules.
        This <strong>increases re-use</strong> of available code and <strong>reduces duplication</strong> of work</li>
    <li><strong>deCrex checks</strong> adherence of every source code repository, application module and build server to configured rules.
        This <strong>eases sharing</strong> among the development teams and <strong>insures integrity</strong> of environment configurations</li>
    <li><strong>deCrex builds</strong> map of dependencies among scanned software modules.
        This helps to
        <ul>
            <li>asses impact of changes in any module on its dependents;</li>
            <li>determine products, which are affected by discovered defect or security/license vulnerability;</li>
            <li>determine obsolete modules, which are not needed for deliveries or for internal tooling</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Why does deCrex do this?</h3>

<p>With growth of number applications being developed or number of applicationsâ€™ versions being supported by 
a company it becomes very easy to lose overview of the information and artifacts, which is stored among dispersed 
systems. Even when the projects are being well documented, a harmless change to one of these systems can make the 
documentation obsolete, information not available. In such situations it becomes very difficult to quickly respond 
to a customer request to resolve a defect and to implement a new feature in an affected application.</p>
