<h3>Development Environment Cross Examiner</h3>

<p>With growth of number applications being developed or number of applicationsâ€™ versions being supported by 
a company it becomes very easy to lose overview of the information and artifacts, which is stored among dispersed 
systems. Even when the projects are being well documented, a harmless change to one of these systems can make the 
documentation obsolete, information not available. In such situations it becomes very difficult to quickly respond 
to a customer request to resolve a defect and to implement a new feature in an affected application.</p>

<p>deCrex 
<ul>
<li>scans configurations and data of systems used in development environment</li>
<li>cross-matches the retrieved data and</li>
<li>reports on gaps and violations of the company policies</li>
</ul>
This will automatically create an accurate description of development environments of the applications, which were ever (are) developed by the company. The new system will alarm when part of project information becomes unavailable or when a project stops adhering to the company policies for development environment.
