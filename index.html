<h3>What is deCrex?</h3>

<p><strong>deCrex</strong> is an intranet application, which learns content and configurations of software development environment systems
    and then reports on their consistency and completeness. By doing this <strong>deCrex insures</strong> development <strong>environment
    enables teams</strong> to find the code, to build, to test and to deliver software</p>

<h3>What does deCrex do?</h3>

The entire functionality of the application can be divided into three areas:

<ul>
    <li>Since <strong>deCrex scans and understands</strong> the content of source code repositories and build servers, it becomes a
        searchable knowledge base with automatically retrieved and added descriptions of available software modules.
        This <strong>increases re-use</strong> of available code and <strong>reduces duplication</strong> of work</li>
    <li><strong>deCrex checks</strong> adherence of every source code repository, application module and build server to configured rules.
        This <strong>eases sharing</strong> among the development teams and <strong>insures integrity</strong> of environment configurations</li>
    <li><strong>deCrex builds</strong> map of dependencies among scanned software modules and, to ease search and
        categorization, it allows tagging of the modules and propagating the assigned tags either up or down the <strong>dependencies
        tree</strong>. This helps to
        <ul>
            <li>asses impact of changes in any module on its dependents;</li>
            <li>determine products, which are affected by discovered defect or security/license vulnerability;</li>
            <li>determine obsolete modules, which are not needed for deliveries or for internal tooling</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Why does deCrex do this?</h3>

<p>With growth of number applications being developed or number of applicationsâ€™ versions being supported by 
a company it becomes very easy to lose overview of information in dispersed software development environment
systems. Even when the projects are being well documented, a harmless change to one of these systems can make the 
documentation obsolete, information not available. In such situations it becomes very difficult to quickly respond 
to a customer request to resolve a defect and to implement a new feature in an affected application.
deCrex addresses these problems</p>

<h3>What deCrex is not?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>deCrex scans descriptions of the modules, however it does not analyze the source code. It's not a replacement
        for code quality management platforms like SonarQube</li>
    <li>deCrex will help you to find dependents of a module with problematic license. However it's not a complete solution
        for licenses management like Black Duck</li>
</ul>
